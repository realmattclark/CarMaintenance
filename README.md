# CarMaintenance

As a car owner, I would like to have quick and easy access to ALL of my maintenance records on hand to improve trade-in and resale value.

myCar is a one of a kind app that gives users the ability to record all self and professional maintenance performed on the user's car. Users will also have the ability to store photos for proof, the ability to download records into PDF format to email to potential buyers and eventually an in-app messaging system to send to other users.

Making use of API's for vehicle databases and businesses, the app will be able to automatically update with the most recent repair, the mileage of the car at time of service and where it was performed, be it at a repair shop or right in their driveway!
